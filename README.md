## 🚨 V2 in Development

CCPlugins V2 is currently in active development due to recent Anthropic updates (SDK improvements, native subagents, context memory, and enhanced CLI capabilities). Several slash commands have become redundant as Claude Code CLI now handles them natively.

V2 will be a complete architectural redesign focusing on what Claude Code still can't do efficiently.

**Current version (v1) remains stable and functional.**

/todos-to-issues       # Convert code TODOs to GitHub issues
/undo                  # Safe rollback with git checkpoint restore
```


## Enhanced Features

### 🔍 Validation & Refinement
Complex commands now include validation phases to ensure completeness:
```bash
/refactor validate   # Find remaining old patterns, verify 100% migration
/implement validate  # Check integration completeness, find loose ends
```

### 🧠 Extended Thinking
Advanced analysis for complex scenarios:
- **Refactoring**: Deep architectural analysis for large-scale changes
- **Security**: Sophisticated vulnerability detection with chain analysis

### 🔗 Pragmatic Command Integration
Natural workflow suggestions without over-engineering:
- Suggests `/test` after major changes
- Recommends `/commit` at logical checkpoints
- Maintains user control, no automatic execution

## Real World Example

### Before `/cleanproject`:
```
src/
├── UserService.js
├── UserService.test.js
├── UserService_backup.js    # Old version
├── debug.log               # Debug output
├── test_temp.js           # Temporary test
└── notes.txt              # Dev notes
```

### After `/cleanproject`:
```
src/
├── UserService.js          # Clean production code
└── UserService.test.js     # Actual tests preserved
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### High-Level Architecture

CCPlugins transforms Claude Code CLI into an intelligent development assistant through a sophisticated yet elegant architecture:

```
Developer → /command → Claude Code CLI → Command Definition → Intelligent Execution
    ↑                                                                       ↓
    ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Clear Feedback & Results ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

### Execution Flow

When you type a command:

1. **Command Loading**: Claude reads the markdown definition from `~/.claude/commands/`
2. **Context Analysis**: Analyzes your project structure, technology stack, and current state
3. **Intelligent Planning**: Creates execution strategy based on your specific situation
4. **Safe Execution**: Performs actions with automatic checkpoints and validation
5. **Clear Feedback**: Provides results, next steps, and any warnings

### Core Architecture Components

**🧠 Intelligent Instructions**
- First-person conversational design activates collaborative reasoning
- Strategic thinking sections (`<think>`) for complex decision-making
- Context-aware adaptations without hardcoded assumptions

**🔧 Native Tool Integration**
- **Grep**: Lightning-fast pattern matching across codebases
- **Glob**: Intelligent file discovery and project mapping
- **Read**: Content analysis with full context understanding
- **Write**: Safe file modifications with automatic backups
- **TodoWrite**: Progress tracking and task management
- **Task**: Sub-agent orchestration for specialized analysis

**🛡️ Safety-First Design**
- Automatic git checkpoints before destructive operations
- Session persistence for cross-context continuity
- Rollback capabilities with clear recovery paths
- No AI attribution in commits or generated content

**🌐 Universal Compatibility**
- Framework-agnostic with intelligent auto-detection
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Works with any programming language or stack
- Adapts to your project's conventions and patterns

### Advanced Features

**🔄 Session Continuity**
Commands like `/implement` and `/refactor` maintain state across Claude sessions:
```
# Each command creates its own folder in project root:
refactor/                  # Created by /refactor command
├── plan.md               # Refactoring roadmap
└── state.json            # Completed transformations

implement/                 # Created by /implement command
├── plan.md               # Implementation progress
└── state.json            # Session state and decisions

fix-imports/              # Created by /fix-imports command
├── plan.md               # Import fixes plan
└── state.json            # Resolution progress

security-scan/            # Created by /security-scan command
├── plan.md               # Vulnerabilities and fixes
└── state.json            # Remediation progress

scaffold/                 # Created by /scaffold command
├── plan.md               # Scaffolding plan
└── state.json            # Created files tracking
```

**🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture**
Complex commands orchestrate specialized sub-agents:
- Security analysis agent for vulnerability detection
- Performance optimization agent for bottleneck identification
- Architecture review agent for design pattern analysis
- Code quality agent for maintainability assessment

**📊 Performance Optimizations**
- Reduced verbosity for senior developer efficiency
- Smart caching of project analysis results
- Incremental processing for large codebases
- Parallel execution of independent tasks

## 🧠 Technical Notes

### Design Philosophy

**Why This Approach Works** (Based on Anthropic's Research):
- **Conversational Commands**: First-person language ("I'll help...") activates Claude's collaborative reasoning
- **Build-Agnostic Instructions**: No hardcoded tools = works everywhere
- **Think Tool Integration**: Strategic thinking improves decisions by 50%+ (Anthropic, 2025)
- **Native Tools Only**: Uses Claude Code's actual capabilities, not imaginary APIs

**Key Principles:**
- **Simplicity > Complexity**: Start simple, add only when proven necessary
- **Context Awareness**: Commands adapt to YOUR project, not vice versa
- **Safety First**: Git checkpoints before any destructive operation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from your codebase, not assumptions

### Technical Architecture

**Native Tool Integration:**
All commands leverage Claude Code CLI's native capabilities:
- Grep tool for efficient pattern matching
- Glob tool for file discovery
- Read tool for content analysis
- TodoWrite for progress tracking
- Sub-agents for specialized analysis

**Safety-First Design:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Pre-operation checkpoint" || echo "No changes to commit"
```

**Conversational Interface:**
Commands use first-person collaborative language ("I'll analyze your code...") rather than imperative commands, creating a natural partnership interaction that improves model performance.

**Framework Agnostic:**
Intelligent detection without hardcoded assumptions enables universal compatibility across technology stacks.

### User Commands Indicator
Custom commands appear with a `(user)` tag in Claude Code CLI to distinguish them from built-in commands. This is normal and indicates your commands are properly installed.

```
/commit
    Smart Git Commit (user)    ← Your custom command
/help
    Show help                  ← Built-in command
```

## Security & Git Instructions

All commands that interact with git include security instructions to prevent AI attribution:

**Commands with git protection:**
- `/commit`, `/scaffold`, `/make-it-pretty`, `/cleanproject`, `/fix-imports`, `/review`, `/security-scan`
- `/contributing`, `/todos-to-issues`, `/predict-issues`, `/find-todos`, `/create-todos`, `/fix-todos`

These commands will NEVER:
- Add "Co-authored-by" or AI signatures
- Include "Generated with Claude Code" messages
- Modify git config or credentials
- Add AI attribution to commits/issues

You can modify these instructions in individual command files if needed.
