# End Coding Session

I'll summarize this coding session and update the project memory using Claude Code CLI's native memory system.

Let me analyze what we accomplished by:
1. Looking at what files were created/modified
2. Checking git changes made during the session
3. Updating CLAUDE.md with session summary

```bash
# Check what changed during the session
echo "Analyzing changes made during this session..."
git diff --stat $(git rev-parse HEAD~1 2>/dev/null || echo HEAD) 2>/dev/null || echo "No git changes detected"

# Update CLAUDE.md with session summary
if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
    echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
    echo "### Session Summary - $(date)" >> CLAUDE.md
    echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
else
    echo "# Project Memory" > CLAUDE.md
    echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
    echo "## Session Summary - $(date)" >> CLAUDE.md
    echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
fi
```

## Session Summary:

### Accomplished:
