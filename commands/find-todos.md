# Find TODOs

I'll locate all TODO comments and unfinished work markers in your codebase.

I'll search for these patterns:
- **TODO/FIXME/HACK**: Tasks, known issues, temporary workarounds
- **XXX**: Warnings or problematic code  
- **NOTE**: Important notes indicating incomplete work

For each marker found, I'll show:
1. File location with line number
2. The full comment with context
3. Surrounding code for understanding

Results organized by priority:
- **Critical** (FIXME, HACK, XXX): Issues that could cause problems
- **Important** (TODO): Features or improvements needed
- **Informational** (NOTE): Context needing attention

This helps you track and prioritize unfinished work in your codebase.
