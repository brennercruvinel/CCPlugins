# Start Coding Session

I'll begin a documented coding session using Claude Code CLI's native memory system to track progress and maintain context.

Recording session information in CLAUDE.md with:
- Timestamp: Current date/time
- Git state: Current branch and commit
- Session goals: What we aim to accomplish

```bash
# Create or update CLAUDE.md with session context
if [ ! -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
    echo "# Project Memory" > CLAUDE.md
    echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
fi

echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "## Coding Session - $(date)" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "**Started:** $(date)" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "**Branch:** $(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo 'no git')" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "**Commit:** $(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo 'no git')" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "### Session Goals:" >> CLAUDE.md
```

Please tell me:
1. What are we working on today?
2. What specific goals do you want to accomplish?
3. Any context I should know about?

I'll document these goals in CLAUDE.md and track our progress throughout the session using Claude's native memory system.
