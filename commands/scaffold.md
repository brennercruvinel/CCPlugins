# Intelligent Scaffolding

I'll create a complete feature structure based on your project patterns.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` - feature name or component to scaffold

First, let me analyze your project architecture:
- Existing code organization patterns using Glob and Read tools
- File naming conventions and directory structures
- Testing approaches and documentation patterns
- Configuration and build patterns

I'll scaffold the feature following your established patterns:
- Generate all necessary files (logic, tests, documentation)
- Apply consistent naming conventions from your codebase
- Include appropriate boilerplate based on existing code
- Maintain architectural consistency

When creating multiple components, I'll use a todo list to track progress systematically.

I'll detect and follow your project's patterns for:
- File organization and naming
- Import/export structures
- Testing frameworks and patterns
- Documentation standards
- Configuration approaches

After scaffolding, I'll create a commit:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Scaffold: $ARGUMENTS feature structure"
```

The scaffolded feature will be:
- Immediately functional with basic implementation
- Following your project's established conventions
- Including appropriate tests and documentation
- Ready for development without configuration

If no patterns are detected, I'll use modern best practices while asking for guidance on project-specific preferences.

This creates complete, consistent features that integrate seamlessly with your existing codebase.
