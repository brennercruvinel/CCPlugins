# TODOs to GitHub Issues

I'll scan your codebase for TODO comments and create GitHub issues automatically.

```bash
# Verify GitHub repository and tools
if ! git remote -v | grep -q github.com; then
    echo "Error: No GitHub remote found"
    exit 1
fi

if ! command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: GitHub CLI (gh) not found. Install from: https://cli.github.com"
    exit 1
fi

if ! gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Error: Not authenticated. Run: gh auth login"
    exit 1
fi
```

I'll scan for TODO patterns and create issues with:
1. Descriptive titles based on comment content
2. File location and code context
3. Appropriate labels

This converts your development notes into trackable GitHub work items.
