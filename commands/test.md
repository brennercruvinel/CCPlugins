# Smart Test Runner

I'll run your project tests and help with any failures.

I'll analyze the project structure to identify test configuration:
- Test directories and naming patterns
- Configuration files and build scripts
- Test command definitions

After running tests, I'll:
1. Parse failures and show specific errors
2. Explain what's wrong and suggest fixes
3. Help resolve dependency or configuration issues

If no tests are found, I'll show search patterns used and suggest testing framework setup.

My goal is to help you understand and fix test failures effectively.
