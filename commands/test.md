# Smart Test Runner

I'll run the tests for this project and help with any failures.

I'll detect your testing setup automatically by analyzing project structure and configuration files without assuming specific frameworks.

After running tests, I'll:
1. Show specific failures with clear explanations
2. Suggest fixes for common issues
3. Help resolve dependency or configuration problems

If no tests are found, I'll show what I searched for and offer to help set up testing if needed.

If tests can't run, I'll provide the exact error and suggest solutions based on your project setup.

My goal is helping you understand and fix test failures while maintaining test integrity.
