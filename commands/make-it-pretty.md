# Make It Pretty

I'll improve code readability while preserving exact functionality.

```bash
# Safety backup
git add -A
git commit -m "Backup before prettifying code" || echo "No changes to commit"

BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/.claude/.prettify_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
```

I'll improve:
- Variable and function names for clarity
- Code organization and structure
- Remove unused code and clutter
- Simplify complex expressions
- Add missing type annotations
- Group related functionality

My approach ensures all functionality remains identical while transforming working code into maintainable code.

```bash
# Commit improvements
git add -A
git commit -m "Prettify code: improve readability and organization" || echo "No changes made"
```
