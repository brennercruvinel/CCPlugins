# Auto Format Code

I'll format your code using the project's configured formatter.

I'll check for formatter configuration in:
- Configuration files and build scripts
- Editor settings and code style definitions

I'll format only modified files to avoid unnecessary changes and focus on relevant code.

If no formatter is found, I'll suggest appropriate formatters for your project type.
If formatting fails, I'll show the error and suggest fixes.

After formatting, I'll show you what changed to ensure consistent code style.
