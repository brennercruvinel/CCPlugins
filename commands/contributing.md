# Complete Contribution Strategy

I'll analyze everything needed for your successful contribution by comparing your local changes against the project's standards and remote state.

**Phase 1: Project Standards Analysis**
I'll examine all project documentation and architecture:
- **Read** CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE files
- **Analyze** .github workflows, issue templates, PR templates
- **Check** code patterns, naming conventions, architectural decisions
- **Review** commit history for maintainer preferences and patterns

**Phase 2: Remote vs Local Comparison**
I'll compare your current state with the remote repository:
- **Git diff** and **git status** to see all your changes
- **Identify** what you've implemented that differs from remote
- **Detect** files added, modified, or architectural changes made
- **Analyze** your technical implementations against project standards

**Phase 3: Gap Analysis**
I'll determine what needs to be done for successful contribution:
- Documentation updates (README, CHANGELOG, new features)
- Test coverage requirements and missing tests
- Code style compliance and architectural alignment
- Commit message format and PR requirements

**Phase 4: Issue Search & Deduplication**
Before suggesting actions, I'll search the remote repository:
- **Check existing issues** to avoid creating duplicates
- **Find related discussions** that strengthen your contribution
- **Identify maintainer feedback** patterns from past PRs
- **Suggest linking** to existing issues when beneficial

**Phase 5: Action Plan Creation**
When I find multiple items, I'll create a todo list with prioritized actions:
- **Critical items** that could block PR acceptance
- **Recommended improvements** for better approval chances
- **Optional enhancements** based on project patterns

I'll provide specific guidance:
- Exact files to update and how
- Required documentation changes
- Testing strategies that fit the project
- PR description template following project standards

**Final Decision**: "How should we proceed with the identified items?"
- Create GitHub issues: I'll create properly formatted issues following project templates
- Link to existing issues: I'll suggest related issues to reference for context
- Direct implementation: I'll guide you through immediate improvements
- Mixed approach: Combination based on complexity and project patterns

This ensures maximum probability of PR acceptance by following all project standards and community expectations while avoiding duplicate work.
