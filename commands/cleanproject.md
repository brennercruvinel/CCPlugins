# Clean Project

I'll help clean up development artifacts while preserving your working code.

First, let me create a safety checkpoint if possible, then identify what should be cleaned based on:
- Our conversation history
- Common development patterns
- Temporary files and artifacts

I'll look for and remove:
- Debug/log files
- Temporary files
- Failed implementation attempts
- Development artifacts
- Debug statements in code

Before removing anything, I'll:
1. Show you what I plan to remove
2. Explain why it should be removed
3. Wait for your confirmation

After cleanup, I'll verify the project still works properly.

The goal is to keep only the clean, working solution.
