# Clean Project

I'll help clean up development artifacts while preserving your working code.

First, let me create a safety checkpoint and backup:

```bash
# Create backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/.claude/.ccplugins_backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
echo "Creating safety backup at: $BACKUP_DIR"

# Verify critical directories are protected
if [ -d "$HOME/.claude" ]; then
    echo "âœ“ .claude directory detected and will be protected"
fi
```

Then I'll identify what should be cleaned based on:
- Our conversation history
- Common development patterns
- Temporary files and artifacts

I'll look for and remove:
- Debug/log files
- Temporary files
- Failed implementation attempts
- Development artifacts
- Debug statements in code

Important: I will NEVER remove:
- The .claude directory (contains commands and configurations)
- .git directory
- Essential configuration files
- Source code files unless explicitly identified as temporary

When I find multiple items to clean, I'll use the TodoWrite tool to create a progress-tracked todo list to process them safely.

Before removing anything, I'll:
1. Add each item to TodoWrite with file path and reason for removal
2. Show you what I plan to remove
3. Create backups of files before deletion
4. Explain why it should be removed
5. Wait for your confirmation
6. Mark as completed in TodoWrite when processed

If the cleanup encounters any errors:
- I'll stop immediately
- Report what failed
- Ensure partial changes can be rolled back
- Suggest alternative approaches

After cleanup, I'll verify the project still works properly by:
- Checking build/compile status
- Running basic sanity checks
- Confirming no critical files were affected

The goal is to keep only the clean, working solution while maintaining safety.
