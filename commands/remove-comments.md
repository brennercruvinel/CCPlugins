# Remove Obvious Comments

I'll clean up redundant comments while preserving valuable documentation.

I'll remove comments that:
- Simply restate what the code does
- Add no value beyond the code itself
- State the obvious (like "constructor" above a constructor)

I'll preserve comments that:
- Explain WHY something is done
- Document complex business logic
- Contain TODOs, FIXMEs, or HACKs
- Warn about non-obvious behavior
- Provide important context

For each file, I'll show you the redundant comments found, explain why they should be removed, and apply the changes for cleaner, more maintainable code.
