# Predictive Code Analysis  

I'll analyze your codebase to predict potential problems before they impact your project.

I'll use native tools for comprehensive analysis:
- **Grep tool** to search for problematic patterns
- **Glob tool** to analyze file structures and growth
- **Read tool** to examine complex functions and hotspots

I'll examine:
- Code complexity trends and potential hotspots
- Performance bottleneck patterns forming
- Maintenance difficulty indicators
- Architecture stress points and scaling issues
- Error handling gaps

For each prediction, I'll:
- Show specific code locations with file references
- Explain why it's likely to cause future issues
- Estimate potential timeline and impact
- Suggest preventive measures with priority levels

When I find multiple issues, I'll create a todo list for systematic review and prioritization.

Analysis areas:
- Functions approaching complexity thresholds
- Files with high change frequency (potential hotspots)
- Dependencies with known issues or update requirements
- Performance patterns that don't scale
- Code duplication leading to maintenance issues

After analysis, I'll ask: "How would you like to track these predictions?"
- Create todos: I'll add items to track resolution progress
- Create GitHub issues: I'll generate properly formatted issues with details
- Summary only: I'll provide actionable report without task creation

Predictions will include:
- Risk level assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Estimated timeline for potential issues
- Specific remediation recommendations
- Impact assessment on project goals

This helps prevent problems before they impact your project, saving time and maintaining code quality proactively.
