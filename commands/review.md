# Code Review

I'll review your code for potential issues.

I'll examine recent changes and current files for:

**Security Issues**: Hardcoded credentials, input validation, vulnerabilities

**Common Bugs**: Null/undefined handling, error handling gaps, logic errors

**Performance**: Inefficient patterns, memory leaks, unnecessary operations

**Code Quality**: Dead code, overly complex functions, missing error handling

For each issue found, I'll show the location, explain the problem, and suggest fixes.

If multiple issues exist, I'll create a prioritized todo list to address them systematically.
