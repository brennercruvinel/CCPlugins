# Comprehensive Code Review

I'll conduct a thorough code review using specialized sub-agents to provide focused, expert-level analysis while preserving our main context.

## Review Process

I'll orchestrate three specialized sub-agents, each with deep expertise in their domain:

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Analysis
I'll delegate security analysis to my specialized security sub-agent who will:
- Scan for vulnerabilities and security risks
- Check for exposed credentials and sensitive data
- Analyze authentication and authorization patterns
- Review input validation and injection risks
- Assess dependency security

### ‚ö° Performance Analysis  
I'll engage my performance sub-agent who will:
- Identify algorithmic inefficiencies and bottlenecks
- Analyze memory usage and potential leaks
- Review I/O operations and concurrency patterns
- Suggest optimization opportunities
- Evaluate scalability concerns

### üîß Code Quality Analysis
I'll utilize my code quality sub-agent who will:
- Review code structure and organization
- Identify code smells and anti-patterns  
- Check error handling and robustness
- Analyze maintainability and readability
- Suggest refactoring opportunities

## Coordinated Analysis

Each sub-agent will provide:
- **Focused Expertise**: Deep analysis in their specialized domain
- **Detailed Findings**: Specific issues with locations and solutions
- **Prioritized Recommendations**: Critical issues highlighted first
- **Actionable Fixes**: Concrete steps to resolve each issue

## Review Execution

Let me begin by running each specialized analysis:

1. **Security Review**: `/review-security` - Comprehensive security analysis
2. **Performance Review**: `/review-performance` - Performance optimization analysis  
3. **Code Quality Review**: `/review-quality` - Maintainability and structure analysis

I'll preserve our conversation context while each sub-agent provides their specialized analysis, then synthesize the findings into a comprehensive review summary.

If any sub-agent encounters errors:
- I'll continue with other analyses
- Report what couldn't be analyzed
- Focus on accessible code areas

This multi-agent approach ensures thorough coverage while maintaining focused expertise in each domain.
